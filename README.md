# Postinstall

Helper tool to configure an [(X)Ubuntu](https://xubuntu.org/) operating system right after it has been installed.

â†’ You can [download the latest pre-built release](https://github.com/gandrille/postinstall/releases/latest), or [build it yourself](#build).


## Usage

Syntax : `postinstall <command>`

Here is the output produced with `postinstall help` 

```
General infos

User install configures user desktop with nice defaults (according to me!)
user-install-info    describes what the installer does
user-install         runs the installer

user-backup [file]   saves the user defined config to a file
